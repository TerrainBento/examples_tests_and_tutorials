    "# Welcome to TerrainBento\n",
    "\n",
    "You have just cloned the `examples_test_and_tutorials` repository for the TerrainBento multi-model package. Congratulations! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in reading about the details of TerrainBento, this package is described in the following OpenAccess manuscript [REF MANUSCRIPT].\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for the package is provided at [LINK TO DOCUMENTATION].\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook exists to provide a hyperlinked guide to the supporting examples, tests, and tutorials we have created in support of this package. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "TerrainBento was designed to make it easy to create comparable models in Earth surface dynamics. The package has 37 alternative models and a model base class that makes it possible to make additional models within the same framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model, called Basic evolves topography using stream power and linear diffusion. It has the following governing equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - KA^{1/2}S + D\\nabla^2 \\eta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other models modify Basic by adding or changing a process component. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Coupled Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides links to five notebooks that show the usage of five example models provided in TerrainBento. In each of these notebooks we provide the governing equation(s) for the model, initialize and run the model, make a slope-area plot, save a NetCDF of the final topography, and plot a image of the final topography. \n",

    "2) [BasicVm](steady_state_solutions/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_001_COUPLED_steady_solution.ipynb) which permits the drainage area exponent to change\n",
    "\n",
    "3) [BasicCh](steady_state_solutions/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_040_COUPLED_steady_solution.ipynb) which uses a non-linear hillslope erosion and transport law\n",

    "5) [BasisRt](steady_state_solutions/notebooks/coupled_process_elements/model_800_COUPLED_steady_solution.ipynb) which allows for two lithologies with different K values\n",

    "## End Member Process Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the process elements presented in TerrainBento have an analytical solution that can be tested in order to ensure that the model is behaving as expected. For example, linear hillslope erosion and transport predicts parabolic hillslopes and stream power erosion makes a slope-area plot with a defined form. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show that TerrainBento's models produce the expected model behavior. We do not examine all 37 models here, but through the 17 models presented here we document the end member behaviour of \n",
